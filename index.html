                <p>Thick white clouds are present in this JunoCam image of Jupiter's equatorial zone. These clouds complicate the interpretation of infrared measurements of water. NASA has decided to reasearch the atmosphere of jupitar by escape vlocity detection method.</p>

                <p>: The general observer (GO) proposals are the most common, covering routine observations</p>
                <p>: Snapshot observations are those in which targets require only 45 minutes or less of telescope time. Snapshot observations are used to fill in gaps in the telescope schedule which cannot be filled by regular GO programs.</p>
                <p>: Astronomers may have Target of Opportunity proposals in which observations are scheduled if a unique transient event covered by the proposal occurs during the scheduling cycle, such as observations of comets that have been newly discovered.
